## 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

### Definition:
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. In JavaScript, you can perform web scraping using various libraries and tools. One popular choice is to use a library called "Puppeteer" along with some other JavaScript libraries like Axios or Cheerio. Here's an overview of how you can perform web scraping in JavaScript:

1. `Setting up your Environment:`
	- Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system, as many of the web scraping libraries are Node.js modules.

2. `Installing Dependencies:`
	- You'll need to install the necessary libraries for your web scraping project. Here are some common ones:
		- uppeteer: Puppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It's great for scraping websites with dynamic content.
		- Axios: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests. It's useful for fetching static web pages and API data.
		- Cheerio: Cheerio is a library that provides a jQuery-like API for parsing HTML in Node.js. It's helpful for extracting data from HTML documents.

You can install these libraries using npm:
```
npm install puppeteer axios cheerio
```
3. `Writing the Web Scraping Script:`
	- Use Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate to the target website, and interact with the page.
	- Alternatively, you can use Axios to make HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content of the web page.
	- Use Cheerio to parse and manipulate the HTML content, extracting the data you need.

Here's a basic example using Puppeteer:

```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  const pageContent = await page.content();

  console.log('Title:', pageTitle);
  console.log('Page Content:', pageContent);

  await browser.close();
})();
```
Here's a simple example using Axios and Cheerio:
```
const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');

axios.get('https://example.com')
  .then((response) => {
    const html = response.data;
    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
    const pageTitle = $('title').text();
    console.log('Title:', pageTitle);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
4. `Handling Data:`
	- Once you've retrieved the HTML content and extracted the data, you can process it as needed. This might involve filtering, cleaning, and structuring the data into a usable format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a database).

5. `Respect Website Policies:`
	- Always check a website's terms of service and robots.txt file to ensure you're not violating any rules or copyright laws when scraping their data. Be respectful of their policies.

6. `Error Handling:`
	- Implement proper error handling in your code to deal with issues like network errors, page not found, or unexpected changes in the website's structure.

##
Web scraping can be a powerful tool for data collection and automation, but it should be used responsibly and ethically. It's important to be aware of legal and ethical considerations when scraping data from websites.
