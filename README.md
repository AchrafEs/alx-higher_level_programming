"PYTHON":

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python emphasizes code readability and provides an extensive standard library,
making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.

Key features of Python include:
1. Readability: Python's syntax is designed to be easily readable and expressive,
   with a focus on clear and concise code.
2. Interpreted: Python code is executed by an interpreter, which translates and runs
   the code line by line, without the need for a separate compilation step.
3. Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare
   variable types explicitly. Variable types are inferred at runtime.
4. Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles,
   allowing you to define and work with classes and objects.
5. Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides
   pre-built modules and functions for various tasks,
   such as file I/O, network communication, and data manipulation.
6. Third-Party Packages: Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party packages and libraries,
   making it easy to extend its functionality for specific needs, such as web development,
   data analysis, machine learning, and more.
   These packages are managed and installed using tools like pip and conda.
7. Cross-platform: Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS,
   and various Unix-like systems, making it highly portable.

Python is widely used in various domains, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis
artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scripting. It has a large and active community
that contributes to its development, maintains packages, and provides support through forums, tutorials
and documentation.
