## 0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery

### Definition of jQuery:

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify common tasks in web development. It provides an easy-to-use API for working with HTML elements, event handling, animations, and AJAX requests.

Here are some key points about jQuery:

1. `DOM Manipulation:` jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation by offering a concise and consistent way to select and modify HTML elements. It abstracts cross-browser differences, making it easier for developers to work with the DOM.

2. `Event Handling:` jQuery provides a streamlined approach to handling events. You can attach event handlers to elements and respond to user interactions with minimal code.

3. `Animation:` jQuery offers animation and effects methods, making it straightforward to create interactive and visually appealing web elements.

4. `AJAX:` jQuery simplifies making asynchronous requests to the server using AJAX. This allows you to fetch or send data without page reloads, improving the user experience.

5. `Cross-Browser Compatibility:` One of jQuery's main strengths is its ability to handle cross-browser inconsistencies. It ensures that code works consistently in different web browsers.

##
In summary, JavaScript is the fundamental programming language of the web, while jQuery is a library built on top of JavaScript to simplify common web development tasks. jQuery is especially helpful when you need to handle DOM manipulation, event management, animations, and AJAX requests in a consistent and more accessible manner. However, it's important to note that as of my last update in January 2022, jQuery usage has declined, and many developers have shifted towards using modern JavaScript and other libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for web development.
