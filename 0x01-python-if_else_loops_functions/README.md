1. 'if' statements:

	if statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.
	They allow your code to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.
	The basic syntax of an if statement in Python is as follows:

	if condition:

		# Code to execute if the condition is true

	The code block under the if statement is executed only if the condition is evaluated as True.
	You can also include an optional else statement to specify an alternative code block to execute when
	the condition is False.

2. 'else' statements:

	else statements are used in conjunction with if statements to provide an alternative code block
	to execute when the condition in the if statement is False.
	The basic syntax of an if-else statement in Python is as follows:

	if condition:

		# Code to execute if the condition is true
	else:

		# Code to execute if the condition is false

	The code block under the else statement is executed only if the condition in the
	if statement is evaluated as False.

3. Loops:

	Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
	In Python, there are two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

		- for loops:

		for loops are used to iterate over a sequence
		(such as a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object.
		The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is as follows:

			for item in iterable:
				# Code to execute for each item
		
		The code block under the for loop is executed for each item in the iterable object.

		- while loops:

		while loops are used to repeatedly execute a code block as long as a certain
		condition is True. The basic syntax of a while loop in Python is as follows:
			
			while condition:

				# Code to execute as long as the condition is true

		The code block under the while loop is executed as long as the condition is evaluated as True.
		Be cautious when using while loops to avoid infinite loops.

	These control flow structures (if, else, and loops) are fundamental building blocks in Python programming
	and allow you to create more complex and dynamic behavior in your code.
