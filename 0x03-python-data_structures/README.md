`0x03-python-data_structures`

In Python, data structures are like containers that allow you to store and organize different
types of data. It's kind of like having different kinds of boxes to store your toys, books, or
other things.

Let's talk about three common data structures in Python:

1.  Lists: Imagine you have a big bag where you can put different things in order. In Python, a
    list is just like that bag. You can put many items in a list, such as numbers, words, or even
    other lists. You can also change the order of the items in the list or add and remove items
    whenever you want.
2.  Dictionaries: Think of a dictionary as a book that has words and their meanings. In
    Python, a dictionary is similar. It has a collection of words, called "keys," and each key has
    a corresponding meaning, called a "value." You can use a key to quickly find its meaning
    in the dictionary.
3.  Sets: Imagine you have a special box where you can only put unique things. In Python, a
    set is similar to that box. It only allows you to store unique items. If you try to put the same
    item in the set twice, it will only keep one. Sets are useful when you want to keep track of a
    group of unique things.

These data structures are like tools that help you organize and work with your data in
different ways. Depending on what you need to do, you can choose the right data structure
to help you solve problems or perform tasks efficiently.

Remember, learning about data structures is just like learning how to organize your things in real life.
Once you understand how to use these tools, you can do amazing things with your data in Python!
